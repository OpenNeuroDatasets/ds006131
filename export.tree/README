# PAFIN: PennLINC AFfective INstability

PAFIN is an ongoing study acquiring a wide range of imaging and phenotypic data in a sample of 100 participants.

The first release of the dataset contains data from the first 49 participants in the study, along with two pilot subjects.

## Dataset contents

### Structural MRI

Each participant has one T1-weighted and one T2-weighted structural scan.
Additionally, we acquired a 5-echo MEGRE scan with magnitude and phase reconstruction for quantitative susceptibility mapping.

### Functional MRI

Each participant has two fMRI runs: one with an AP phase encoding direction while watching the Pixar short "Bao"
and one with a PA phase encoding direction while watching the Pixar short "Your Friend the Rat".

One of the pilot subjects has a resting-state run instead of a "Bao" run.

Each run includes 5 echoes and magnitude+phase reconstruction.

Concurrent physiological recordings were acquired using a respiration belt and a pulse oximeter,
although we have not performed quality control on these recordings yet.

### Diffusion MRI

One 92-direction compressed sensing diffusion spectrum imaging (CS-DSI) run was acquired for all participants.
Magnitude and phase reconstruction was enabled in order to improve denoising.

### Perfusion MRI

One single-delay, background-suppressed PCASL scan was acquired for all participants
(post-labeling delay = 1.8 s, labeling duration = 1.8 s).

A reference scan was also acquired to assist in ASL calibration.
This reference scan includes two volumes: an M0 scan and a presaturated inversion recovery volume.
The M0 volume is retained in the perfusion folder with the `m0scan` suffix,
and a copy of the M0 volume, along with the inversion recovery volume,
are retained in the `anat` folder with the `TDP` suffix.
This type of scan is not supported in BIDS, so we used the custom `TDP` suffix (transit delay prescan).
We may change this in the future if BIDS starts supporting this type of scan.

### Field maps

Multi-echo field gradient echo PEpolar-style field maps (`acq-func+meepi`) were acquired for all participants.
For each acquisition, we have created a copy of the first echo (`acq-func`) as the primary field map.

Field maps were also acquired for the diffusion data (`acq-dwi`) with the opposite phase encoding direction as the CS-DSI scans.

### Phenotypic data

A number of self-report measures were collected from participants.
These measures include the following:

- Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Screening Tool (`phenotype/ahc_hrsn`)
- Affective Reactivity Index (`phenotype/ari`)
- Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (`phenotype/best`)
- BIS/BAS Reward Subscale Child (`phenotype/bisbas_reward_child`)
- Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (`phenotype/cats`)
- Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (`phenotype/ders`)
- Emotion Regulation Questionnaire - Short Form (`phenotype/erq_s`)
- Extended Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior (`phenotype/eswan_adhd`)
- Extended Strengths and Weaknesses Assessment of DMDD Symptoms and Normal Behavior (`phenotype/eswan_dmdd`)
- Ultra-Short Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (`phenotype/mctq_us`)
- Neighborhood Community Cohesion Short-Form (`phenotype/ncc`)
- Neighborhood Safety and Crime Short-Form (`phenotype/nsc`)
- Patient Health Questionnaire 8-Item (`phenotype/phq8`)
- PRIME Screen Revised 5-Item (PRIME-5-SR) (`phenotype/prime5_sr`)
- PROMIS Pediatric Sleep Disturbance [Short Form 4a] (`phenotype/promis_sleepdis_ped_4a`)
- Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) (`phenotype/pss4`)
- Socioeconomics (self-report) (`phenotype/ses_sr`)
- Sleep Reduction Screening Questionnaire (`phenotype/srsq`)


### Actigraphy

### Other data

The acquisition date and time for each session was rounded to the 15th of the month and the nearest hour,
and stored in the `*_sessions.tsv` files.
